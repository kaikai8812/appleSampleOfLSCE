/**
 A `TransientAppEntity` represents data that an `EntityQuery` cannot query because the data continually changes, such as a summary
 of workout statistics. This type of app entity is helpful for returning data from an intent so that other intents can use its properties as inputs
 to other intents, enabling powerful workflows in the Shortcuts app.
